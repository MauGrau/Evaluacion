I am from Tokyo. My wife is Chinese. 
We have a lovely daughter.

I love watching foreign dramas, eating ramen, meat and fish dishes.

I am really interested in foreign cultures. 
I am very excited to meet people from all around the world through Airbnb. 
My English is not very good, but I am practicing with my friend Jenny and I practice when I meet airbnb guests. I also learn a lot by reading the messages while communicating with guests.

 I am hosting guests in Japan from all over the world now. And I’m looking forward to travel the world using Airbnb.

I think people who choose to travel to Japan already have a certain interest for Japan, but my goal is to get everyone to love Japan more and more.",within an hour,100%,100%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/357bf330-cf37-4558-9677-72b0f60aef58.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/357bf330-cf37-4558-9677-72b0f60aef58.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Shinjuku District,4,5,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Shinjuku-ku, Tōkyō-to, Japan",Shinjuku Ku,,35.70339,139.69797,Entire home,Entire home/apt,12,2.5,2.5 baths,5.0,5.0,"[""Smoke alarm"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Dryer"", ""Bed linens"", ""TV"", ""Oven"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Hangers"", ""Heating"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Exterior or entryway security camera present"", ""Microwave"", ""Rice maker"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Self check-in"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Hair dryer"", ""High chair"", ""Shampoo"", ""Private entrance"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Keypad"", ""Bathtub"", ""Body soap"", ""Kitchen"", ""Stove"", ""Washer"", ""Iron"", ""Hot water"", ""Essentials"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""First aid kit"", ""Paid parking off premises"", ""Wifi"", ""Conditioner""]","$140,000.00",2,90,1.0,3.0,1125.0,1125.0,2.0,1125.0,,t,8,15,23,263,2025-03-24,222,38,4,181,41,228,31920000.0,2017-07-01,2025-03-17,4.87,4.87,4.84,4.91,4.93,4.83,4.71,Hotels and Inns Business Act | 新宿区保健所 | 31新保衛環第204号,t,4,4,0,0,2.36

My name is Kei.

Thank you for visiting my account!

Let me introduce myself first, 

I used to work in financial field and often went on a business trip in the U.S and some big cities in Asia.
My business went pretty well, but it was such an intensive work. I was always under huge pressure, especially during the business trip. So, on my business trip, I mostly preferred staying at Airbnb than hotels as I could put myself in relaxing and comfortable situation that I felt like I was at home. 

Through my Airbnb experience, I got a glimpse of new other culture while talking to the owner of the Airbnb and other guests. This experience was unforgettable for me, and I got interested in communication with people in other culture.

Recently, I’ve settled down my life here in Tokyo, then, decided to be an Airbnb host to welcome people from all over the world. 

In order for you to feel “Real Japan Life”, I carefully chose furniture and household items in my apartment. 

Hope you will like my apartment and have a great time in Tokyo!

Thank you.

I am 26 years old, studied at Waseda University in Tokyo.
I spent my high school days in Australia and New Zealand.
When I think back the past, this was a life changing event for me. I stayed at some hosts' places and I had a warm welcome from them.
And I thought that time I would love to host travelers from all over the world. 

I, myself like to travel like you all do.
In (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , I went to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
And last year, I visited France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
Hopefully I will visit other beautiful places this year.
I might stay with some of you when I go visit your place :)

I'm not a perfect host but I'm trying to be perfect!
Any kind of feedback is really appreciated.
Let me make your trip a wonderful one.

Hope you have a wonderful time here!
Thank you,

My name is Keisuke.
I am 26 years old, studied at Waseda University in Tokyo.
I spent my high school days in Australia and New Zealand.
When I think back the past, this was a life changing event for me. I stayed at some hosts' places and I had a warm welcome from them.
And I thought that time I would love to host travelers from all over the world. 

I, myself like to travel like you all do.
In (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , I went to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
And last year, I visited France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
Hopefully I will visit other beautiful places this year.
I might stay with some of you when I go visit your place :)

I'm not a perfect host but I'm trying to be perfect!
Any kind of feedback is really appreciated.
Let me make your trip a wonderful one.

Hope you have a wonderful time here!

My name is Keisuke.
I am 26 years old, studied at Waseda University in Tokyo.
I spent my high school days in Australia and New Zealand.
When I think back the past, this was a life changing event for me. I stayed at some hosts' places and I had a warm welcome from them.
And I thought that time I would love to host travelers from all over the world. 

I, myself like to travel like you all do.
In (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , I went to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
And last year, I visited France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
Hopefully I will visit other beautiful places this year.
I might stay with some of you when I go visit your place :)

I'm not a perfect host but I'm trying to be perfect!
Any kind of feedback is really appreciated.
Let me make your trip a wonderful one.

Hope you have a wonderful time here!

My name is Keisuke.
I am 26 years old, studied at Waseda University in Tokyo.
I spent my high school days in Australia and New Zealand.
When I think back the past, this was a life changing event for me. I stayed at some hosts' places and I had a warm welcome from them.
And I thought that time I would love to host travelers from all over the world. 

I, myself like to travel like you all do.
In (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , I went to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
And last year, I visited France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
Hopefully I will visit other beautiful places this year.
I might stay with some of you when I go visit your place :)

I'm not a perfect host but I'm trying to be perfect!

I am 26 years old, studied at Waseda University in Tokyo.
I spent my high school days in Australia and New Zealand.
When I think back the past, this was a life changing event for me. I stayed at some hosts' places and I had a warm welcome from them.
And I thought that time I would love to host travelers from all over the world. 

I, myself like to travel like you all do.
In (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , I went to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.
And last year, I visited France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
Hopefully I will visit other beautiful places this year.
I might stay with some of you when I go visit your place :)

I'm not a perfect host but I'm trying to be perfect!
Any kind of feedback is really appreciated.
Let me make your trip a wonderful one.

Hope you have a wonderful time here!

My name is Kei.

Thank you for visiting my account!

Let me introduce myself first, 

I used to work in financial field and often went on a business trip in the U.S and some big cities in Asia.
My business went pretty well, but it was such an intensive work. I was always under huge pressure, especially during the business trip. So, on my business trip, I mostly preferred staying at Airbnb than hotels as I could put myself in relaxing and comfortable situation that I felt like I was at home. 

Through my Airbnb experience, I got a glimpse of new other culture while talking to the owner of the Airbnb and other guests. This experience was unforgettable for me, and I got interested in communication with people in other culture.

Recently, I’ve settled down my life here in Tokyo, then, decided to be an Airbnb host to welcome people from all over the world. 

In order for you to feel “Real Japan Life”, I carefully chose furniture and household items in my apartment. 

Hope you will like my apartment and have a great time in Tokyo!
